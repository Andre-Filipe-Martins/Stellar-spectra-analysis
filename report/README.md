# Stellar Spectra Project (Report)

## Overview
This repository contains the written report for a stellar spectra analysis project completed as part of my BSc coursework. This is a group project where the report itself is public.

## What I did
- Organization: In charge of noting the hours dedicated by each group member to each task of the project and reevaluating our work strategy
- Participated in the research necessary to the development of the algorithm
- Adaptated an existing team python script to the needs of the group
- Development of spectral analysis script to analyze the impact of stellar surface spots.
- Full analysis and interpretation of the effects of stellar spots on the star's spectrum.

## Contents
- `report/`: final report (in French)

## Code availability
The code for this project cannot be shared publicly because it was developed collaboratively as part of a group submission and is not solely my intellectual property.

## Skills demonstrated
Python • data cleaning and analysis • algorithm development support • script development • results validation and interpretation • documentation/reporting • teamwork and planning
